# Feature Evaluation Criteria

When deciding which features to implement for the Pan Samochodzik platform, use the following evaluation criteria to prioritize development efforts.

## User Value (0-10)

Assess how much value the feature provides to the platform's users:

- **10**: Feature is essential and directly addresses core user needs
- **7-9**: Feature provides significant value to most users
- **4-6**: Feature is useful but only to some users or in specific situations
- **1-3**: Feature provides minimal value to a small subset of users
- **0**: Feature provides no discernible value to users

## Technical Complexity (0-10)

Evaluate the technical difficulty of implementing the feature:

- **10**: Extremely complex, requiring new technologies or major architecture changes
- **7-9**: High complexity, requiring significant development effort
- **4-6**: Moderate complexity, requiring average development effort
- **1-3**: Low complexity, easily implemented with existing technologies
- **0**: Trivial, can be implemented with minimal effort

_Note: Lower scores are better for this criterion_

## Integration with Existing Systems (0-10)

Assess how well the feature integrates with existing functionality:

- **10**: Seamlessly integrates and enhances multiple existing features
- **7-9**: Strong integration with at least one existing feature
- **4-6**: Moderate integration, works alongside existing features
- **1-3**: Weak integration, operates mostly independently
- **0**: No integration, completely standalone feature

## Market Differentiation (0-10)

Evaluate how well the feature helps differentiate the platform from competitors:

- **10**: Unique feature not available in competing platforms
- **7-9**: Significantly better implementation than competitors
- **4-6**: On par with competing platforms
- **1-3**: Below competitor offerings
- **0**: Far behind competitor offerings

## Development Time (0-10)

Estimate the time required to develop the feature:

- **10**: Extensive development (months)
- **7-9**: Significant development (weeks)
- **4-6**: Moderate development (days)
- **1-3**: Minimal development (hours)
- **0**: Trivial development (immediate)

_Note: Lower scores are better for this criterion_

## Business Impact (0-10)

Assess the feature's impact on business metrics:

- **10**: Directly impacts core business metrics (revenue, retention)
- **7-9**: Significant impact on secondary business metrics
- **4-6**: Moderate business impact
- **1-3**: Minimal business impact
- **0**: No measurable business impact

## Maintenance Burden (0-10)

Evaluate the long-term maintenance requirements:

- **10**: Requires constant maintenance and monitoring
- **7-9**: Requires regular maintenance
- **4-6**: Requires occasional maintenance
- **1-3**: Requires minimal maintenance
- **0**: Requires no maintenance

_Note: Lower scores are better for this criterion_

## Feature Evaluation Matrix

Use the following table template to evaluate and compare features:

| Feature | User Value | Technical Complexity | Integration | Market Differentiation | Development Time | Business Impact | Maintenance Burden | Total Score |
|---------|------------|---------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Feature A | 8 | 4 | 7 | 9 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 20* |
| Feature B | 6 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 8 | 4 | 6 | -3* |

_*Total score calculation: User Value + Integration + Market Differentiation + Business Impact - Technical Complexity - Development Time - Maintenance Burden_

## Prioritization Framework

1. **Must-Have**: Score > 15
2. **Should-Have**: Score 5-15
3. **Nice-to-Have**: Score 0-5
4. **Defer/Reconsider**: Score < 0

This framework helps ensure that development resources are allocated to features that provide the most value with reasonable implementation costs.
